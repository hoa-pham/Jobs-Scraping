For this coding challenge, you'll be creating a simple job board in Python and Flask. A user should be able to visit the site, click on a company they're interested in working for, and then see a list of all the positions open at that company. For each position, a user should be able to see the Position Title, Company, and Location. The user should also be able to click on the position and be directed to the actual open job listing.

While we have our core requirements for the project, we love it when people get creative. So if you want to get fancy, then that's fine by us! We love people that have fun while they work, and if you join our team that's the environment you're jumping into!

There are 3 companies you must include on the site:

    Twilio (Link to Career Page)
    Airbnb (Link to Career Page)
    Yext (Link to Career Page)

Requirements

    Must use Python 3 and Flask (this is what InternBlitz is built with)
    Must have all positions from the 3 companies listed above
    Positions must be dynamically pulled from career pages (if a new position is added an hour before, your app should catch it)
    Each position must include the Position Title, Company, Location, and link to job application
    Navigation between pages should be accounted for

What we're looking to test

Note: Depending on how you implement your solution, some or all of these areas will be tested.

    Competency in developing web applications
    Competency in Python and Flask (or your ability to pick up a new language and framework)
    Competency in API usage and API development
    Competency in web scraping
    Communication ability (mainly, how you communicate with us when you run into problems or issues)

Information that might help

    Talking through your solution with us before coding may save some time
    You don't need to spend too much time styling or improving your html, but style points are definitely considered
